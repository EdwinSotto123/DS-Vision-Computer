# DS-Vision-Computer

## Description

Welcome to my Computer Vision projects repository. This collection showcases various projects I have developed, focusing on solving diverse tasks within the field of computer vision, including object detection, image segmentation, color classification, and more.

## Featured Projects

- **Clothing Detection and Dominant Color Identification:** Leveraging YOLOv8 to segment clothing items and applying advanced techniques to accurately identify dominant colors, even in cases where color differentiation is subtle.

- **Skin Color Classification with YOLOv8:** A project focused on classifying skin color into predefined categories using a YOLOv8 model optimized for facial detection.

- **Person Detection in Video:** Development of a system that detects individuals based on their clothing characteristics and color, allowing results to be saved according to specific matching levels.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python, C++
- **Models:** YOLOv8, DenseNet121
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, OpenCV
